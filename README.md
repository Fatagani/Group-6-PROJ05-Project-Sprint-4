# 🥝 FoodWeb  🕸 

<p align="justify">
Foodweb is an innovative digital platform designed to combat food waste by creating a seamless bridge between food donors such as restaurants and grocery stores and community recipients like shelters and food banks. By leveraging intelligent algorithms, real-time data integration, and a user-friendly interface, Foodweb optimizes donation matching and pickup routes, ensuring that surplus food is quickly and efficiently redirected to those in need.

# Project Objective
- 🥗 Reduce food waste by redirecting surplus food from donors (restaurants, groceries) to shelters and food banks.

- 🔄 Develop an efficient redistribution system that matches food donations with recipients based on need and proximity.

- 🛣️ Optimize pickup and delivery routes using data structures and algorithms (e.g., greedy or bin-packing algorithms).

- 💻 Design and implement a scalable and maintainable system using the MVC architecture with Python and FastAPI.

- 🧑‍💼 Create a user-friendly interface for donors and recipients using the Flet desktop application.

- 📊 Visualize key performance metrics such as food saved, donor participation, and delivery efficiency using Matplotlib.

- 🌐 Integrate third-party APIs (e.g., Google Maps, Waze) to enhance logistics and navigation.

- 🗃️ Manage food inventory and transactions effectively using a NoSQL database (MongoDB).
