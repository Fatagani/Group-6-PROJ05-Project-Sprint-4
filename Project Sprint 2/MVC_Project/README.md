# MVC Project Structure

This project uses the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.

## Folders:
- `models/`      : Data models
- `views/`       : UI templates/pages
- `controllers/` : Business logic and request handling
- `routes/`      : Route definitions
- `public/`      : Static assets (images, CSS, JS)

## Getting Started
Add your code files to the respective folders. For example, put your data models in `models/`, your homepage template in `views/`, and your main controller in `controllers/`.
